# The Perfect Snake
The Perfect Snake is the first game coded by me.

Completely built with **PyGame**, it is similar to the classical **Snake Game**.

To play the game, go to releases section and download the source code zip folder and then follow the below steps:-

snake-game-0.1 -> output(folder) -> snake-game(folder) -> snake-game(application)
